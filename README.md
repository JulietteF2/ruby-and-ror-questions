  <h1>Ruby and Ruby on Rails Questions</h1>


  ---

  <span>I got inspired by this project: [JavaScript Questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions), and I decided to make one for Ruby and Ruby and Ruby on Rails, because I started to get many examples of refactoring / optimizations from my experiences.</a>

  From basic to advanced: test how well you know Ruby and Ruby on Rails, refresh your knowledge a bit, or prepare for your coding interview! :muscle: :rocket: I added helping tips in the **collapsed sections** below the questions, simply click on them to expand it. It's just for fun, good luck! :heart:</span>

  Feel free to [reach out](https://github.com/AJuliette) if you want tot add some! ðŸ˜Š <br />
